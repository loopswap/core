# Loopswap Core

Loopswap core contracts are the fork of [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core)

Loopswap/Uniswap-V2 contracts are non-upgradeable and hence immutable in nature

In-depth documentation on Uniswap V2 is available at [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org/docs).

The built contract artifacts can be browsed via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/browse/@loopswap/core@latest/).

# Local Development

The following assumes the use of `node@>=10`.

## Changes from Uniswap V2

Not even a single line of code has been changed in the core contracts when compared with Uniswap V2. Hence no changelog.
